## Experience

I thought this project was very helpful. It was a little bit consusing at first but once I understood what was going on I felt that everything got a little bit easier. I originally had everything right and the website wasn't working and I thought I had a bigger issue than what I actually did wrong. So I spend a lot of time trying to change big things when I was just missing the redirects. But overall I did struggle a bit but it did help a lot with me understanding the stack.

## Known issues or Bugs

There are no known issues or bugs that I am aware of.

## Sources used

I hust used the zybooks and the readme. It helped to go back into the zyboks and read some past modules to remember how everything works again.
